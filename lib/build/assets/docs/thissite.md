* Frontend: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [MDL](https://getmdl.io/)
* Backend: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Run on: [GCloud](https://cloud.google.com/) container engine using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

The site is currently containerized with Docker and running on Google Cloud Platform's Container Engine using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). I also did all of the styling and design using React and Google's MDL framework. This site is for all things Eddie. Have a look around!
