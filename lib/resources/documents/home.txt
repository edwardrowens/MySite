# About Myself
Hi, my name is Edward Owens and I'm a software developer whom graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Computing. I began programming while in my junior year of university (3 years ago as of writing this) beginning with an introductory C++ course. Ever since that course I've been hooked and haven't stopped my pursuit of getting better. In that time I've picked up a few more languages like Java, Matlab, R, and some Bash shell scripting. My sights are currently set at becoming a more well-rounded video game and web app developer.
# Previous Position
I previously worked as a technical lead in Dr. Marjorie Solomon's neuroscience lab which studied ASD (autism spectrum disorder). My duties ranged widely from scanning subjects, analyzing data, and creating scripts and pipelines for preprocessing and segmenting fMRI data. I primarily used Matlab, R, and a bit of Linux scripting to accomplish these tasks. Towards the end of my time at the lab I began to apply graph theory to connectivity data to compare networks employed by ASD patients during inferential reasoning tasks. The paper, based upon the results I uncovered, is currently in the process of being written.
# Current Position
I am currently working as a web app developer for a piece of software called ALFA Systems for CHP Consulting. ALFA is a large scale, end-to-end, asset finance web app which is currently servicing many clients with highly varied demands and profiles. My developments ranged from framework maintenance to developing completely new features to the product. I utilized test-driven development techniques and Java to deliver my developments. While developing I used Google's DI framework ([Google Guice](https://github.com/google/guice)) not only to facilitate testing, but to loosely couple dependencies and allow for easier future developments. I used the JUnit testing framework to ensure the quality of my developments I also wrote integration tests via Selenium to ensure my developments played nicely with the rest of the application. Alongside these frameworks I used multiple utility libraries such as [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) and [Apache Commons](https://commons.apache.org/).
# Side Projects
In order to develop my knowledge and skills as a software engineer, I have taken up game development using C++ in my spare time. The game is a simple real-time 2D shooter with multiplayer via a simple server client model. I utilize [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) for multimedia and rendering, [Box2d](http://box2d.org/) for physics, [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) and the STL for utility, [Asio](http://think-async.com/) for asynchronous network programming and the STL Thread library for multi-threading as well as GitHub for version control.
# Future Prospects
During my time at CHP I've gained an appreciation for web app development and have been learning JavaScript (React) and Node.js in order to gain a better understanding of the entire process of web app development. I am also always continuing to build upon my game. Currently I'm smoothing over the multiplayer aspect and working on refactoring some frameworks that I developed early on in the project.
